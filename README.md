# VirtualizorJS

Since there is no SDK's for Node.js for the Virtualizor API, I decided to create one, and one that is actually easy to use and useful with **0 Dependencies** keeping it `Lightweight` and `Fast`.

VirtualizorJS simplifies the management of Virtualizor servers with a streamlined and developer-friendly API for Node.js. Perform actions such as creating, starting, stopping, and restarting virtual servers effortlessly. Ideal for seamless integration into your Node.js applications, providing a powerful toolkit for Virtualizor server management.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/virtualizorjs.png)](https://badge.fury.io/js/virtualizorjs)

## Important
 - As of `19 January 2024` Not all Virtualizor API functions are tested fully. ( i m busy (just lazy lmao))

## Installation

```bash
npm i virtualizorjs@latest
```

## Usage

```javascript

const VirtualizorClient = require('virtualizorjs');

// Initialize VirtualizorClient
const { ListVPS } = new VirtualizorClient({
  host: '< IP or Hostname of Virtualizor Server >',
  port: 4083,
  key: "< Your API KEY >",
  pass: "< Your API PASS >",
});

// Using const client = new VirtualizorClient({ ... }) is also valid, but you will have to use client.ListVPS() instead of ListVPS() which just looks ugly.
// Example: Get a list of all VPSs
ListVPS().then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
```

# Event Handling Usage

VirtualizorJS uses the [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) class to handle events. You can attach **`Event Listeners`** to different events provided by the VirtualizorClient.

- Note: We define the "on" method as "eventOn" to avoid confusion with the EventEmitter's "on" method, However you can do it however you want this is just an example.

```javascript
const VirtualizorClient = require('virtualizorjs'); 

// We define the "on" method as "eventOn" to avoid confusion with the EventEmitter's "on" method, However you can do it however you want this is just an example.
// The "eventOn" method is used to attach Event Listeners to different events provided by the VirtualizorClient.
const { on: eventOn } = new VirtualizorClient({
  host: '< IP or Hostname of Virtualizor Server >',
  port: 4083,
  key: "< Your API KEY >",
  pass: "< Your API PASS >",
});

// - Event Types - :
// 1. vpsCreated
// 2. vpsStarted
// 3. vpsStopped
// 4. vpsRestarted

// Event listener for when a virtual server is created
eventOn('vpsCreated', (response) => {
  console.log(`Virtual Server Created! Details:`, response);
});

// Event listener for when a virtual server is started
eventOn('vpsStarted', (response) => {
  console.log(`Virtual Server Started! Details:`, response);
});

// Event listener for when a virtual server is stopped
eventOn('vpsStopped', (response) => {
  console.log(`Virtual Server Stopped! Details:`, response);
});

// Event listener for when a virtual server is restarted
eventOn('vpsRestarted', (response) => {
  console.log(`Virtual Server Restarted! Details:`, response);
});
```

## ‚ùì What's the point of using **`Event Listeners`**?
 - **`Event Listeners`** are useful when you want to perform an action when a certain event occurs without modifying the source code of the **`VirtualizorJS`** library to avoid breaking changes.
 - For example, you can use **`Event Listeners`** to send a notification to your `users` when a event is triggered.
 - You can also use **`Event Listeners`** to perform an action when a event is triggered.

- [Create VPS](/examples/createvps.js)

## Documentation

- Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/kkMihai/virtualizorjs/wiki) for detailed documentation.
- If you use frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) make sure to use it only Server-Side for security reasons.

## Roadmap
  - [ ] Add Proxmox KVM Support
  - [ ] Add Virtualization Types enums
